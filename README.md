* DynamoDB global tables replicate data automatically across your choice of AWS Regions and automatically scale capacity to accommodate your workloads.
* The AWS Professional Services organization is a global team of experts that can help you realize your desired business outcomes when using the AWS Cloud.
* The AWS Partner Network (APN) is the global partner program for technology and consulting businesses that leverage Amazon Web Services to build solutions and services for customers.
* Weighted routing lets you associate multiple resources with a single domain name (example.com) or subdomain name (acme.example.com) and choose how much traffic is routed to each resource.
* Each AWS Region consists of a minimum of three Availability Zones (AZ).
* Each Availability Zone (AZ) consists of one or more discrete data centers.
* With AWS you trade capital expense for variable expense and eliminate guessing on your infrastructure capacity needs.
* Amazon EFS is a file storage service for use with Amazon EC2. Amazon EFS provides a file system interface, file system access semantics, and concurrently-accessible storage for up to thousands of Amazon EC2 instances.
* The performance of AWS managed Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) instance is better than a customer-managed database instance.
* AWS Artifact is your go-to, central resource for compliance-related information that matters to your organization. It provides on-demand access to AWS security and compliance reports and select online agreements.
* An instance store provides temporary block-level storage for your instance. This storage is located on disks that are physically attached to the host computer. This is a good option when you need storage with very low latency, but you don't need the data to persist when the instance terminates or you can take advantage of fault-tolerant architectures.
* You can remove an account from your organization only if the account has the information that is required for it to operate as a standalone account.
* You can use AWS X-Ray to analyze and debug serverless and distributed applications such as those built using a microservices architecture.
* You can use Amazon Transcribe to add speech-to-text capability to your applications. Amazon Transcribe uses a deep learning process called automatic speech recognition (ASR) to convert speech to text quickly and accurately.
* You can use Amazon Polly to turn text into lifelike speech thereby allowing you to create applications that talk.
* Data transfer between S3 and EC2 instances within the same region is not charged.
* The AWS Cloud Adoption Framework (AWS CAF) leverages AWS experience and best practices to help you digitally transform and accelerate your business outcomes through innovative use of AWS. Common stakeholders include Chief Technology Officer (CTO), technology leaders, architects, and engineers.
* AWS Pricing Calculator lets you explore AWS services and create an estimate for the cost of your use cases on AWS.
* You should use AWS Business Support if you have production workloads on AWS and want 24x7 phone, email and chat access to technical support and architectural guidance in the context of your specific use-cases. You get full access to AWS Trusted Advisor Best Practice Checks. You also get access to Infrastructure Event Management for an additional fee.
* Amazon Inspector is an automated security assessment service that helps improve the security and compliance of applications deployed on your Amazon EC2 instances. Amazon Inspector automatically assesses applications for exposure, vulnerabilities, and deviations from best practices.
* EBS volume can be attached to a single instance in the same Availability Zone (AZ) whereas EFS file system can be mounted on instances across multiple Availability Zones (AZ).
* AWS Direct Connect is a cloud service solution that makes it easy to establish a dedicated network connection from your premises to AWS. You can use AWS Direct Connect to establish a private virtual interface from your on-premise network directly to your Amazon VPC, providing you with a private, high bandwidth network connection between your network and your VPC. This connection is private and does not go over the public internet. It takes at least a month to establish this physical connection.
* By default, the log files delivered by CloudTrail to your S3 bucket are encrypted using server-side encryption with Amazon S3 managed keys (SSE-S3).
* Amazon EC2 spot instances let you take advantage of unused EC2 capacity in the AWS cloud. Spot instances are available at up to a 90% discount compared to the on-demand instance prices.
* The AWS Product team is responsible for applying patches to the underlying OS for AWS Aurora.
